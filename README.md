## General idea

In this phase, the objective lies in creating an Entity-Relationship-Model (ERM), which will be the basis of the database structure. The database modeling process is crucial to guarantee a well-functioning database. A methodology and a deep dive into different entities, attributes, and relationships are necessary.

## What is Airbnb?

Airbnb is the world's most popular marketplace for lodging, homestays, vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Tourists looking for a trip anywhere in the world can book via the platform. There are three roles on the platform: guests, hosts, and Airbnb itself.

## What roles are on Airbnb?

The platform needs guests who seek and pay for the rentals. Airbnb needs hosts who create the content and list their apartments. And then there is Airbnb itself which acts as middleman connecting hosts willing to rent their apartments to guests.






## Installation

It is first necessary to install MySQL on your system. Afterward, the data mart can be used with any MySQL database system. I suggest the MySQL Workbench community version, a free DBMS, that can also open the model file, which is a .mwb file located in the development directory.
MySQL can be installed from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
MySQL Workbench can be installed from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
After creating a database connection and a schema, using the data import tool in the server tab, you can import the mydb.sql file, which is in the finalization directory.
